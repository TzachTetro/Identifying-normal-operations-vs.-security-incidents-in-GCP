# Identifying-normal-operations-vs.-security-incidents-in-GCP

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to develop and implement methods for distinguishing between normal activities and security incidents within Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By leveraging GCP's monitoring and logging tools, this project aims to enhance the detection and response capabilities, ensuring the integrity and security of cloud-based operations.

## Features

- Real-time Activity Monitoring: Continuously monitors GCP resources and activities in real-time.
- Anomaly Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from normal activity patterns.
- Log Analysis: Analyzes audit logs to detect potential security incidents.
- Incident Alerts: Sends alerts and notifications when suspicious activity is detected.
- Automated Incident Response: Triggers automated responses to mitigate identified threats.
- Dashboard Visualization: Provides a comprehensive dashboard to visualize activity and incidents.
- Customizable Rules: Allows for the creation and customization of rules for identifying incidents.
